# devmachine

These are some quick and dirty scripts to make my life a little easier when I set up a development machine from scratch, whether Windows or Linux or both.

1. Read 'em - there are handy comments at the top
2. Make 'em executable or set the execution policy
3. Run 'em in order and install stuff as you go
