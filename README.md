# devmachine

These are some quick and dirty scripts to make it a little easier to set up my development machine from scratch, whether Windows or Linux or both.

## Instructions

Before running a script, take a peek at the comments at the top, because sometimes you need to do something before the script will work (i.e. set execution policy, make the script executable, run as administrator, etc.).

Find the scripts that pertain to your environment (Windows, Ubuntu full install, or Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux) and run them in order. After each one, install manually downloaded software and/or reboot as necessary before running the next script. The "configure" script assumes that you have already cloned a private configuration repository, so if that's not the case, just comment out the section that restores config files.
